    <p>
      This website is designed to serve as my personal portfolio, 
      developed initially as part of a project for CS351 at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, 
      where I am currently pursuing a degree in Information and Computer Science. 
      While it began as a class assignment, 
      I plan to continue to update it, in terms of structure and content, with the goal of developing a well designed portfolio. 
      The site highlights a range of my projects, both technical and otherwise, along with many other things,
      such as work and life experience, etc. 
      Below is a list of what you can expect from each page...
