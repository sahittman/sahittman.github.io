		<h1>About Me (Not Covered Elsewhere)</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>First 12 years</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I was born and raised in Wichita, KS. Well, for a while at least. 
				Wichita is a relatively large city, standing consistantly arond a population of ~400,000.
				My parents focused intently on finding a good Elementary School for me.
				After going throught the magnet school application program, I was able to attend their first choice: 
				<em>McLean Science and Technology Magnet Elementary School </em>.
				It was there I realized an interest in computers and technology.
				Computers were just something I couldn't wrap my head around.
				What I now know as abstraction had appeared to be an endless hole of confusion with no end.
				Luckily I was able to join the robotics team in 4th and 5th grade, Where we used 
				<em>Lego Mindstorms </em>
				to design robots to accomplish different tasks and mazes.
				Eventually going to
				<em>Wichita State University </em>
				to spend a day competing and trying to get a best time.
				After finishing fifth grade, my Father got a Job in Baraboo Wisconsin,
				and it was time to move.

			<h2>Wisconsin</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I attended 
				<em>Baraboo Middle School </em>
				for sixth grade.
				I got involved in the Code Club, which tought us the basics of html and css.
				My first project was about types of Star Wars Ships.
				Me and my friend then teamed up to make a website,
				exploring 
				<em>ADVANCED </em>
				ideas... like as a navbar and header image.
				Eventually we learned (throught copy and paste) how to dynamically build a site 
				using query links so the above ideas didn't have to be copied for each page.
				I have since had to relearn everything I once knew about html and css (within the past year),
				as I haven't touched it since middle school.
				I took a Java class in highschool and enjoyed it, eventually deciding to attend UW-Madison
				and work towards a major in Information Science and a certificate in Computer Science.
